<h2><i>Culture in Ireland</i></h2>

<section class="culture">
<p>The culture of Ireland includes the art, music, dance, folklore, traditional clothing, language, literature, cuisine and sport associated with Ireland and the Irish people. For most of its recorded history, the country’s culture has been primarily Gaelic (see Gaelic Ireland). Strong family values, wit and an appreciation for tradition are commonly associated with Irish culture.

    Irish culture has been greatly influenced by Christianity, most notably by the Roman Catholic Church, and religion plays a significant role in the lives of many Irish people. Today, there are often notable cultural differences between those of Catholic, Protestant and Orthodox background. References to God can be found in spoken Irish, notably exemplified by the Irish equivalent of “Hello” — “Dia dhuit” (literally: "God be with you").

        <h3><i>Gaeilge</i></h3>
        <p>Irish or "Gaeilge" is the official language of Ireland</p>
        <p>Irish is one of the oldest written and historical languages in the world.  It was seen for the first time in Ogham form in the fifth century.
        Today it can be found in up to 4,500 books, on television, radio, newspapers, magazines and on the internet.</p>
        <p>
            Irish is a Celtic language which is closely related to Scottish and Manx Gaelic. 
            It is also related to Welsh, Cornish and Breton. The first speakers of Irish probably arrived on these shores from mainland Europe over 2,500 years ago. It is certain that there were other languages spoken here before Irish but, by the start of the Christian era, Irish was spoken all over Ireland and was spreading through Scotland, the west coast of Britain and the Isle of Mann. 
            The Romans called the Gaels Scotti and they eventually spread the Gaelic language throughout most of Scotland.
        </p>
        <p>
            The oldest remains of Ancient Irish that we have are inscriptions on Ogham stones from the 5th and 6th centuries. 
            Old Irish was first written in the Roman alphabet before the beginning of the 7th century which makes Irish the oldest written vernacular language north of the Alps.

        <h3><i>GAA</i></h3>
        <p> 4 Sports make up the Gaelic Athletics Association: </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Gaelic Football</li>
            <li>Hurling / Camogie</li>
            <li>Handball</li>
            <li>Rounders</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) is Ireland’s largest sporting organisation. It is celebrated as one of the great amateur sporting associations in the world.

            It is part of the Irish consciousness and plays an influential role in Irish society that extends far beyond the basic aim of promoting Gaelic games.
            
            It was founded on November 1 1884 at a meeting in Thurles, Co. Tipperary, by a group of spirited Irishmen who had the foresight to realise the importance of establishing a national organisation to make athletics more accessible to the masses and to revive and nurture traditional,
            indigenous sports and pastimes. At that time, it was largely only the gentry and aristocracy who were allowed to meaningfully participate in athletics.

        <h3><i>Irish Dance</i></h3>
        <p>Irish dance refers to the traditional dance forms that originate in Ireland, including both solo and group dance forms, 
            for social, competitive, and performance purposes. 
            Irish dance has evolved over centuries and is believed to have its roots in ancient Celtic dance.</p>
            <p>In the 17th and 18th centuries, dance was taught by "travelling dance masters" across Ireland, 
                and separate dance forms developed according to regional practice and differing purposes. 
                Irish dance became a significant part of Irish culture, particularly for Irish nationalist movements.</p>
                <p>From the early 20th century, a number of organisations promoted and codified the various forms of dance, 
                    creating competitive structures and standardised styles. Irish dancers who compete for competitive reasons dance in a dance style that is more modern than traditional Irish dance. 
                    It is mainly done solo, but there is some team dancing in groups of 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 16 and even numbers onwards.</p>
                    <p>Irish group dancing has some French influences, and was particularly influenced by the French quadrille in the late 18th century.</p>

        <p>
            Irish cuisine encompasses the cooking styles, traditions and recipes associated with the island of Ireland. 
            It has developed from antiquity through centuries of social and political change and the mixing of different cultures, predominantly with those from nearby Britain and other European regions. 
            The cuisine is founded upon the crops and animals farmed in its temperate climate and the abundance of fresh fish and seafood from the surrounding waters of the Atlantic Ocean. Chowder, for example, is popular around the coasts.
            Herbs and spices traditionally used in Irish cuisine include bay leaves, black pepper, caraway seeds, chives, dill, horseradish, mustard seeds, parsley, ramsons (wild garlic), rosemary, sage and thyme.
        </p>
        <p>
            The development of Irish cuisine was altered greatly by the Tudor conquest of Ireland in the late 16th and early 17th centuries, which introduced a new agro-alimentary system of intensive grain-based agriculture and led to large areas of land being turned over to grain production. 
            The rise of a commercial market in grain and meat altered the diet of the Irish populace by redirecting traditionally consumed products (such as beef) abroad as cash crops instead.
            Consequently, potatoes were widely adopted in the 18th century and essentially became the main crop that the Irish working class (which formed a majority of the population) could afford.
        </p>
        <p>
            By the 21st century, much traditional Irish cuisine was being revived.
            Representative dishes include Irish stew, bacon and cabbage, boxty, brown bread (as it is referred to in the south) or soda bread (predominantly used in Ulster), coddle, and colcannon.
